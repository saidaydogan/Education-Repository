Computer Science teaching plan contains 53 courses, which adds up to 156 credits. The percentages of the courses established as %26 Basic Sciences, %51 Occupational Courses and %23 Other Courses to provide a balanced distribution. The credits of the optional engineering courses are determined as %14 to allow students to gain expertise on the subjects they are interested in.
In our department which aims to graduate engineers to international arena, a compulsory English preparation class has been started beginning from 1985-1986 which continues successfully since. In addition to the preparation class, English courses given in various ways take %10 of the all credits rest of the graduate study, also some of the occupational courses are taught in English.
The program applied in Computer Engineering is prepared by taking the opinion of internal allies (Teaching Staff, Students and Management) and external allies (Graduates, Associations, Private Sector, Government, Civil Community Organizations, Families) then filtered by science and technology. The system is supported with feedback mechanisms (Student Questioners, Evaluations of Teaching Staff, Evaluations of other external allies about outputs and goals) to respond variable features quickly, to provide continuity by renewing itself and to reach its goals.
